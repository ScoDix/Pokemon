The following is the brief for this task.

## Assignment Overview
This project involves using supervised machine learning to model a specific target variable from one of four datasets:
- Wine Quality: Predict wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
- Abalone Age: Estimate the age of abalones using physical attributes.
- Pokemon: Classify Pokemon type using stats and other features.
- Temperature: Predict patients' oral temperature using various physiological and environmental factors.

You are required to:
- Choose one dataset.
- Perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature preparation.
- Apply and compare two machine learning models, selecting one method from each of the following:
  - List 1: Ridge, lasso, or elastic net regression; or Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
  - List 2: Bagging or random forests; or a neural network.
- Evaluate and compare model performance using a validation approach.

## Report Structure
Your report must include the following sections:
1. Introduction (5%): Outline the problem, dataset, and chosen modelling methods.
2. Data Cleaning and EDA (15%): Document data preparation steps and summarize key relationships in the dataset.
3. Modelling (40%): Describe methods used, discuss assumptions, and present results.
4. Model Comparison (20%): Compare model performance and discuss findings.
5. Results and Conclusion (10%): Reflect on results, limitations, and potential next steps.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit a PDF report and a supplementary R or Jupyter notebook file.
- The code should be well-documented and include all packages used.
- Include an appendix for supplementary outputs and a bibliography (APA style recommended).

## Notes
- Focus on the narrative and justification of your approach rather than describing every step.
- Marks are awarded for the structure, clarity, and presentation of the report.
